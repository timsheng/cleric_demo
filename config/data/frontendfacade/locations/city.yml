    summary: "<p>London is everything and its opposite. It’s a grand, striving metropolis
      and a network of villages, hugely diverse in their own distinct character. It’s
      voraciously modern. Iconic skyscrapers overlook global finance, science and technology
      hubs. London oozes the past. Palaces, parliaments and great houses wrapped in stories
      and tradition fill the city. London is glass and stone. But intensely green. Regal
      parks, banks of flowers, mighty trees, heaths and secret gardens pool around its
      cobbles, flagstones, bricks and concrete. It absorbs a vast multitude of cultures.
      It emits its world-changing brew of art, music, fashion and thinking. Living here
      is an experience like nothing else. Choose your village. Find your part in the patchwork
      and dive into the magic.</p>"
