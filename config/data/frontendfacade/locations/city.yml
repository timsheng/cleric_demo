    There’s an eclectic urban mix, with national political institutions, museums and
    world-class universities standing alongside a mish mash of trendy cafés, microbreweries
    and boutiques. And with more restaurants per capita than New York, you’ll never
    be short of somewhere to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sample this compact city on foot, starting
    at Lambton Quay business district and catching Wellington’s iconic red cable car.
    You’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of your new home, followed by a return stroll
    amidst native bush in the Botanic Garden. Next, head south and immerse yourself
    in bohemian Cuba Street, home of hip artists, colourful shops and fire-breathing
    buskers. Feast on a hearty breakfast at Floriditas and end your day in Havana or
    Laundry – just two of the area’s quirky nightlife hotspots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more
    shopping and entertainment head to Courtenay Place, stopping at up-and-coming Hannah’s
    Factory Laneway for a salted caramel cookie on the way. The beach, where you might
    spot dolphins and whales bobbing their heads through the surf, is also never far.
    Take a break from your studies on Oriental Bay’s golden shores, browse the Harbourside
    Market or kick back with ice cream from Kaffee Eis. For a more substantial break,
    catch the Interislander Ferry to the South Island or head to Wellington Airport
    and explore even farther.</p>"
